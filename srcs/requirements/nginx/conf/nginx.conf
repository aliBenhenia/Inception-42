    # Optionally, you can add more server blocks for other domains or HTTP redirections
}
# Sure, let’s simplify the NGINX configuration with a real-world example where NGINX acts as a reverse proxy server for an application running on a different server. 

# ### Scenario

# You have a website, `example.com`, that needs to be served securely over HTTPS. Your NGINX server will:

# 1. **Securely handle HTTPS requests**.
# 2. **Serve static files** (like HTML, CSS, images) directly.
# 3. **Forward PHP requests** to another server (e.g., a WordPress server).

# ### Configuration Breakdown

# Here’s how you’d configure NGINX to achieve this:

# ```nginx
# http {
#     server {
#         listen 443 ssl;  # Listen for HTTPS requests on port 443.
#         server_name www.example.com example.com;  # Handle requests for these domains.

#         # Paths to SSL certificate and private key for HTTPS
#         ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl_cer.crt;
#         ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl_cer_key.key;

#         # Use TLS version 1.3 for secure connections
#         ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;

#         # Directory where static files (HTML, CSS) are stored
#         root /var/www/html;
#         # Default files to serve if a directory is requested
#         index index.php index.html;

#         # Handle requests for static files (like HTML, CSS, images)
#         location / {
#             try_files $uri $uri/ =404;  # Try to serve the requested file or directory, show 404 if not found.
#         }

#         # Handle PHP requests by forwarding them to a separate server (e.g., WordPress)
#         location ~ \.php$ {
#             include fastcgi.conf;  # Include FastCGI settings.
#             fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;  # Forward PHP requests to the FastCGI server on port 9000.
#         }

#         # You can add more location blocks here if needed for other routing.
#     }

#     # Additional server blocks can be added for different domains or configurations.
# }
# ```

# ### Simplified Explanation

# 1. **`listen 443 ssl;`**:
#    - **What It Does**: Tells NGINX to listen for HTTPS traffic on port 443.
#    - **Example**: If someone visits `https://example.com`, NGINX handles this request.

# 2. **`server_name www.example.com example.com;`**:
#    - **What It Does**: Specifies which domain names this configuration applies to.
#    - **Example**: Requests to both `www.example.com` and `example.com` will be handled by this block.

# 3. **`ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl_cer.crt;`** and **`ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl_cer_key.key;`**:
#    - **What They Do**: Provide the SSL certificate and private key needed for secure HTTPS connections.
#    - **Example**: The files `/etc/nginx/ssl_cer.crt` and `/etc/nginx/ssl_cer_key.key` enable secure communication.

# 4. **`ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;`**:
#    - **What It Does**: Ensures only TLSv1.3 is used for secure connections.
#    - **Example**: Makes sure the latest, most secure version of TLS is used.

# 5. **`root /var/www/html;`** and **`index index.php index.html;`**:
#    - **What They Do**: Set the default directory for static files and default files to serve.
#    - **Example**: Static files (e.g., HTML, CSS) are served from `/var/www/html`. If a directory is requested, `index.php` or `index.html` is served by default.

# 6. **`location / { try_files $uri $uri/ =404; }`**:
#    - **What It Does**: Handles requests for static files.
#    - **Example**: If a user requests `https://example.com/about`, NGINX looks for a file named `about` or a directory named `about`. If neither is found, it shows a 404 error.

# 7. **`location ~ \.php$ { include fastcgi.conf; fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000; }`**:
#    - **What It Does**: Forwards PHP requests to another server (e.g., a WordPress application).
#    - **Example**: If a request is made to `https://example.com/post.php`, NGINX forwards it to `wordpress:9000` where the PHP code is processed.

# ### Real-World Example

# Imagine you have a blog at `https://example.com`:

# - **Static Files**: `https://example.com/index.html` serves the main page of your blog.
# - **PHP Requests**: `https://example.com/post.php` is processed by a WordPress server running on `wordpress:9000`.

# NGINX:

# - Secures the connection with HTTPS.
# - Serves static content directly.
# - Forwards PHP requests to the WordPress server for processing.

# This configuration ensures that all requests to your site are handled securely and efficiently.
