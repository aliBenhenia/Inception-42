Your response captures the essence but needs more detail to fully cover the requirements:

**Corrected Answer:**

The mandatory requirements for the Docker project are:

1. **Create Docker Containers:**
   - **NGINX:** Set up a container with NGINX configured to use only TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3.
   - **WordPress:** Set up a container with WordPress and php-fpm (without NGINX).
   - **MariaDB:** Set up a container with MariaDB (without NGINX).

2. **Volumes:**
   - Create a volume for the WordPress database.
   - Create another volume for WordPress website files.

3. **Networking:**
   - Configure a Docker network to connect the containers.

4. **Configuration:**
   - Use Docker Compose for managing the setup, and ensure each service is built from Dockerfiles that you create yourself (no pulling pre-built images).

5. **Restart Policy:**
   - Ensure that containers are configured to restart automatically in case of a crash.

6. **Avoid Prohibited Practices:**
   - Do not use infinite loops in entrypoints or commands.
   - Use proper PID 1 handling and best practices for Dockerfile creation.
